                    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8; color: #000000;">
                        <strong>Why I chose to redesign Gmail?</strong> As an active job seeker, I have come to rely heavily on Gmail in my daily life. In doing so, I have encountered the common problem of struggling to quickly and efficiently find specific emails among the overwhelming number of messages in my inbox.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="two-column">

                        <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8; color: #000000;">
                            As the world becomes increasingly digital, many people share this frustration of having inboxes filled with both important and unimportant emails, making it difficult to sort and organize them effectively. Even if you are able to find the important emails, you still have to individually read through them, as well as the countless unimportant emails, such as advertisements, coupons, and spam.
                        </p>
                        <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8; color: #000000; margin-top: 20px;">
                            However, currently available email apps do not offer automatic management features to assist users with this problem. By adding this feature to Gmail, I believe it will greatly improve users' experience by making it easier and faster to manage their emails, ultimately increasing their use of the app and allowing them to focus on other aspects of their lives.

                        In order to gain a deeper understanding of the pain points faced by users in managing their emails, user reviews and feedbacks on the existing Gmail app were analyzed. This research method helped identify common issues such as difficulty in filtering and prioritizing emails, lack of customization options and an overwhelming amount of notifications. This information was crucial in informing the design choices for the feature being developed in this UX case study, as it allowed for a targeted approach to addressing specific pain points experienced by users.

                    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8; color: #000000;">
                        Gmail, developed by Google, is a popular email service that is widely used by individuals and businesses worldwide. As a leading email provider, Gmail faces competition from several other email apps and services.
                    </p>
                    <ul style="color: #000000; line-height: 1.8;">
                        <li>One of the main competitors for Gmail is Microsoft Outlook. Outlook, developed by Microsoft, is primarily used by businesses and enterprise users. It offers features such as a calendar, task list, and contact management, which are not available in Gmail. However, Gmail has a larger user base and a more user-friendly interface compared to Outlook.</li>
                        <li>Another major competitor for Gmail is Apple Mail, which is the default email app for iOS devices. Apple Mail has a similar user interface to Gmail and offers a clean and simple design. However, Gmail has more advanced features, such as the ability to add multiple email accounts and the option to use third-party email services.</li>
                        <li>Yahoo Mail is another popular email service that also competes with Gmail. Yahoo Mail offers a similar set of features as Gmail, but it does not have the same level of integration with other Google services, such as Google Calendar and Google Drive.</li>
                        <li>Lastly, there are many other email services like FastMail, ProtonMail, and Zoho Mail, which are also competing with Gmail. These email services are known for their privacy and security features, and they offer similar features as Gmail but with an emphasis on security.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8; color: #000000;">
                        In conclusion, Gmail faces competition from a variety of email apps and services, each with its own unique set of features and strengths. Gmail's main advantage is its integration with other Google services, its user-friendly interface, and its large user base. However, as the market becomes more competitive, Google will have to continue to innovate and improve the features of Gmail to maintain its dominance in the email market.

                        In order to select right color palette for this interface, I considered the demographic characteristics of the target users, which were primarily mature adults. To enhance usability and facilitate ease of navigation, I employed a minimalist design approach and incorporated familiar design elements from widely-used email applications. To further establish a distinct brand identity and differentiate the application from its competitors, I carefully selected a color scheme that would effectively communicate the desired emotional associations. The primary color, Blue, was chosen to evoke feelings of trust and professionalism, while the secondary color, Aqua, was selected to provide a unique visual cue and to serve as an effective differentiation factor. Overall, these design choices aimed to improve the overall user experience and meet the needs of the target users.

“The app is the way to go for busy professionals that want to keep track of their job search and save valuable time by making it easier to sort through all the great opportunities. I can create separate folders and sort my mails in a way that helps me prioritize what requires an answer immediately vs. follow up later. This allows me to follow up with recruiters faster while catching anything I might’ve missed along the way. Seeing expired reminders ~like bills~ allows me to get them out of the endless sea of job offers mails”

“Since I have been using this app, I have been able to sort through all of my coupons and grab great deals before they expire, as well as delete any unnecessary Mails like expired OTP mails.

                        The AI assistant needs to be really strong as it has the potential to make mistakes, The AI which powers this app could mistake an email message for something else. For example, a system might read an important mail as an OTP mail, and put that mail automatically in OTP folder. Once this happens, the user is not likely to check the folder where your system will have mistakenly placed his/her important message. This may cause a serious loss.

While a user is about to delete any mail, we can warn the user that he or she should once go through all the mails before deleting it. We may also notify users on a monthly basis to go through all their automatically placed emails in order to report if they are put in the wrong folder by AI, which will help our AI to improve its algorithm further. Also, The main home screen looks and functions a lot like a classic email app. The inbox will hold all of your email, unsorted. This feature can only be an addition to enable you to find an important mail quickly or delete particular types of mails with just one check rather than scrolling through all of your mails.
